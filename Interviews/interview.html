<h1>Interview Preparation</h1><br>
<h2>What is Technical Interview?</h2><br>
<p>Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for technical professionals: 
    it's a highly focused and rigorous process that assesses your technical skills, personality, and 
    problem-solving abilities. In the same vein as "show, don't tell," you need to demonstrate your 
    skills to the interviewer, rather than just stating them. The purpose of a technical interview isn't 
    to trick you with riddles, brainteasers, or impossible questions, but rather to see how you tackle 
    real-world problems, such as those you may encounter once you get hired.<br>
    Here are a few: <br>
<br>
   <li> Which programming languages do you use regularly in your work?</li>
    <li>Do you have any technical certifications that make you qualified for this job?</li>
    <li>Can you explain the most rewarding project you have worked on so far? Can you elaborate on your part in it?</li>
    <li>What steps do you take to ensure accurate estimates for a project?</li>
</p><br>
<h2>How to prepare Technical Interview</h2><br>
<p>Here are some tips: <br><br>
    An important step is to review the job description to determine what you need to study. This may involve learning data structures, coding in a specific language, or using business intelligence tools.
    Explain your approach to solving problems and logical reasoning. This points out your problem-solving and critical thinking abilities to a hiring manager.
    Do not hesitate to ask for more information if you do not understand the question. In case you do not know the answer to a question, tell the interviewer or ask probing questions to learn more. This may aid you in finding the right answer.
    Attempt coding assignments and brain teasers to improve your programming skills</p><br>

    <h1>MicroSoft Interviews</h1><br>
    <h2>1. Interview Process</h2><br>
    <p><li><b>Recruiter Connect:</b> It is highly recommended to maintain a good LinkedIn profile to get noticed by Microsoft recruiters. It is also advised to connect with existing Microsoft employees to get referrals for job positions. The candidate can also try applying on the job portal.</li>
       <li> <b>Interview Rounds:</b> The interview rounds start with an initial screening interview which is DS/Algo-based. The later rounds are more technical and focus on DS/Algo skills along with system design knowledge.</li>
       <li> <b>After Interviews:</b> The performance of the candidate is judged based on the past interviews and the verdict is decided. All of the interviewers hold a meeting to discuss and debate the ratings of candidates with the hiring manager.</li>
        <li><b>Hired:</b> Once the team and you both are comfortable and ready to start, the offer letter is prepared and shared with you by the recruiters and you are HIRED!</li>
    </p>
<br>
    <h2>2. Interview Rounds</h2><br>
    <p>
       <li><b>Screening Interview(1 Round):</b> A telephone interview could be conducted to see if the candidate is a good fit for Microsoft. It could even be a coding test instead of an interview. It can last 30-45 minutes and cover 2-3 DS/Algo problems.</li>
       <li><b>Onsite Interviews(4-5 Rounds):</b> A series of interviews is conducted. The first few are DS/Algo-based rounds while the later ones are system design rounds. Microsoft likes to ask mostly Array/Strings/LinkedList problems so the candidate is advised to especially prepare these topics. Arriving at the most optimized solution is key here. The design rounds test the candidate’s ability to design complex systems like Gmail, YouTube, Uber etc.</li>
    </p><br>

    <br><h1>Google Interviews</h1><br>
    <h2>1. Interview Process</h2><br>
    <p>
       <li><b>Recruiter Connect:</b> The Recruiter can contact the candidate based on his/her profiles on Linkedin etc or if any of his/her known has referred him/her to the company. However, it’s always best to message the recruiters via LinkedIn and apply for the roles in the Career page of Google. If the candidate is good in DS & Algo skills it is highly recommended that he/she participate in Google Kickstart, this is Google’s hiring contest which happens 6 times in a year. If the performance in those competitions is good the recruiters will contact you easily.</li> 
       <li><b>Interview Rounds:</b> Google has a total of 7 rounds. The first two are telephonic interviews where the interviewer mostly asks one medium or two easy Algo DS problems to the candidate and the candidate has 45 minutes to solve the problems. However if the performance in Kickstart is good, these rounds are skipped and you directly move to the next rounds. Next, we have 5 onsite interviews out of which 4 are Algo DS interviews and 1 is a Googliness interview, Googliness interview is mostly a behavioural interview.</li> 
       <li><b>After Interviews:</b> Once the interviews are over, the recruiter will contact you with the feedback of the interviews, if the performance is good and the interviews are cleared your profile goes to the different teams in Google for the team matching round. In the team matching round the team understands your work style and your interests and you can understand their requirements and the work expectations of the team.</li> 
       <li><b>Hired:</b> Once the team and you both are comfortable and ready to start, the offer letter is prepared and shared with you by the recruiters and you are HIRED!</li>

    <br><h1>Amazon Interviews</h1><br>
    <h2>1. Interview Process</h2><br>
    <p>
        <li><b>Recruiter Connect:</b> Best way to get noticed by Amazon recruiters is to maintain a good Linkedin profile and message recruiters. The candidate can also apply on the Amazon job portal but it is suggested that they also get a referral from an Amazon employee.</li>
        <li><b>Interview Rounds:</b> Amazon conducts four interview rounds alongside an initial coding test. The coding test consists of DS/Algo problems. The first round is an HR round where they ask behavioral questions along with Computer Science theory questions to the candidate. The next three rounds focus solely on DS/Algo.</li>
        <li><b>After Interviews:</b> The recruiter contacts the candidate after these rounds and tells the verdict. They also look at the candidate’s leadership principles along with technical skills.</li>
        <li><b>Hired:</b> Once the team and you both are comfortable and ready to start, the offer letter is prepared and shared with you by the recruiters and you are HIRED!</li>
    </p>
<br>
    <h2>2. Interview Rounds</h2><br>
    <p>
       <li><b>HR Round(1 Round):</b> This is when they ask computer science theory and behavioural questions to the candidate. The questions may enquire about the candidate’s experience at previous companies and conflicts the candidate might have faced with colleagues/managers.</li>
        <li><b>Data Structures and Algorithms Rounds(3 Rounds):</b> The candidate is asked DS/Algo problems where production ready code might be expected from the candidate. It is not out of the realm of possibility to face minor behavioural questions here as well. The problems range from easy to hard but they are not the sole deciding factor for the final offer. Leadership principles also come into play here. The interviews are conducted on Amazon Chime.</li>
